This tool was developed by Harness to assist in the migration process from Spinnaker to CD Next Gen. It can migrate specific Harness resources or multiple resources at once.

### Who is the Tool intended for?

This tool is designed for customers, CSMs, and developers who are currently using Spinnaker and wish to migrate their accounts to Harness CD Next Gen.

### Spinnaker stages that can be migrated
The following key components can be migrated using this tool:
