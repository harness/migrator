# Flags

In order to accommodate various migration scenarios, where entities need to be smoothly transitioned, 
we offer a powerful solution through custom Flags. These Flags enable you to apply specific logic to your migration process.

To utilize these Flags, simply include them in your command with the `--flags` option, like: `--flags HELM_INFRA_WITH_STAGE_VAR`.

## Available Flags
Here's a detailed breakdown of the available Flags and their descriptions:

| Flag name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `HELM_INFRA_WITH_STAGE_VAR` | This helps with migrating Helm-based workflows. In the Next-Generation (NG) implementation, the release name has been relocated from the Helm step to the Infrastructure definition. To facilitate this, this flag introduces Stage variable `autogenerated_release_name` with value of FG Helm step's release name. This is referenced in Helm infrastructure definition with value `<+stage.variables.autogenerated_release_name>`. |
